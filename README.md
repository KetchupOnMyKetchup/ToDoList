# Introduction and Welcome

## THIS PROJECT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AS OF FEBRUARY 2018, TARGETED TO BE COMPLETE NEAR THE END OF THE MONTH

This is a simple proof of concept to display an Azure App Service website communicating with an API project, which communicates to an Azure SQL back-end. The app is a To-Do application based on Microsoft's To-Do List app, but adapted for Azure deploy and to Visual Studio 2017. The project's technology stack is C#, Angular JS, and SQL. 

The tutorial can be completed in full, or partially. Here are the partial paths: 
* If you are uninterested in Azure or are a junior developing learning to code to simply go through Parts 01-03 to understand how applications are setup.  
* If you are seeking to learn Azure and the CI/CD process (and you already know Swagger and Dapper), you can do Parts 01 and 04-07.  
* If you are seeking to learn Azure and the CI/CD process, and you already know how to deploy to Azure manually and are only interested in the CI/CD process (and you already know Swagger and Dapper), you can do Parts 01 and 06-07.  

_Note: Parts 02-03 are optional and purely informational if you would like to learn how to use Swagger or Dapper. Swagger is a useful tool for API management and testing by directly accessing the API endpoints. Dapper is a micro-ORM that is very lightweight and makes accessing the database faster with much less code._


# Tutorial Sections: 
* **[00 Prerequisites, Timing, and Cost:](https://github.com/catenn/ToDoList/wiki/00.-Prerequisites,-Timing,-and-Cost)** I will explain all of the software and accounts required to complete this tutorial. 
* **[01 Local Setup:](https://github.com/catenn/ToDoList/wiki/01.-Local-Setup)** Locally connect a front-end website to an API, and connect the API to a SQL Server. I will explain enough for you to get a local database setup and get the app up and running on your local machine. 
* **[02 Swagger (optional):](https://github.com/catenn/ToDoList/wiki/02.-Swagger)** Learn how to use Swagger for API management
* **03 Dapper (optional):** Learn how to use Dapper micro-ORM to access to database
* **[04 Azure Deployment (manual):](https://github.com/catenn/ToDoList/wiki/04.-Azure-Deployment-(manual))** Deploy the front-end, API, and SQL database to Azure manually
* **05 Adding project to VSTS with Git:** I will show you how to use Git to add your project to VSTS
* **06 VSTS Continuous Integration:** Setup a CI Process in VSTS 
* **07 VSTS Continuous Deployment:** Setup a CD Process in VSTS (automated deploy to Azure)
