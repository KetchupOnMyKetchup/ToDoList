# ToDoList
The To-Do list application is a simple .NET application with a front-end Angular website, API back-end, and SQL Database.  This is a tutorial app with 7 parts. The tutorial will be suitable for the level of a junior developer with little/no experience, or for senior developers who want to learn to use Azure or VSTS's CI/CD process.
